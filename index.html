    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <img src="assets/images/jgs.jpg" class="auth-image">

    <p>Hello there! Come here my little friend. Don't be afraid. Don't worry, he'll be all right. What happened? Rest easy,
      son, you've had a busy day. You're fortunate you're still in one piece. Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to see you!
      The Jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly. Tell me young Luke, what brings you out this far? Oh, this little
      droid! I think he's searching for his former master...I've never seen such devotion in a droid before...there seems
      to be no stopping him. He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he a relative of yours? Do you know who
      he's talking about?
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Red Leader... This is Gold Leader. We're starting out attack run. I copy, Gold Leader. Move into position. Stay in
      attack formation! The exhaust post is... marked and locked in! Switch power to front deflector screens. How many guns
      do you think, Gold Five. I'd say about twenty guns. Some on the surface, some on the towers. Death Star will be in
      range in five minutes. Switching to targeting computer. Computer's locked. Getting a signal. The guns...they've stopped!
      Stabilize your read deflectors. Watch for enemy fighters.
