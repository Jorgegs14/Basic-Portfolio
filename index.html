      <p>Hello there! Come here my little friend. Don't be afraid. Don't worry, he'll be all right. What happened? Rest easy,
        son, you've had a busy day. You're fortunate you're still in one piece. Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to see you!
        The Jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly. Tell me young Luke, what brings you out this far? Oh, this little
        droid! I think he's searching for his former master...I've never seen such devotion in a droid before...there seems
        to be no stopping him. He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he a relative of yours? Do you know
        who he's talking about?
      </p>
      <p>Red Leader... This is Gold Leader. We're starting out attack run. I copy, Gold Leader. Move into position. Stay
        in attack formation! The exhaust post is... marked and locked in! Switch power to front deflector screens. How many
        guns do you think, Gold Five. I'd say about twenty guns. Some on the surface, some on the towers. Death Star will
        be in range in five minutes. Switching to targeting computer. Computer's locked. Getting a signal. The guns...they've
        stopped! Stabilize your read deflectors. Watch for enemy fighters.
